      "text": "Pitfalls to Avoid with Multiple Google Tag Manager Containers\n\nApril 4, 2017\n\nGoogle Tag Manager\n\n0In 2015, Google began to officially support having multiple Google Tag Manager containers on a page. Fast forward nearly two years, and this question is starting to come up more frequently among clients and attendees at our trainings: \u201cIs it OK to have multiple GTM containers on my site?\u201d\n\nAlthough we strongly recommend only implementing one GTM container on the page, there may be some cases where it just isn\u2019t feasible:\n\nTo restrict edit/publish permissions to some (but not all) tags, triggers, and variables\n\nTo allow multiple site \u201cowners\u201d to autonomously tag a site\n\nThese situations are not common, but tend to occur more regularly in large, complex organizations with many stakeholders interested in various aspects of analytics and marketing. For example, consider a large publisher that embeds its content on various third-party domains. The publisher wants their GTM code on the page, but the third-party domains may already have their own GTM code, and may be unwilling (for good reasons) to give the publisher access to their GTM. If you find yourself in this unavoidable boat, be sure to read the about the pitfalls below.\n\nHowever, sometimes the question comes up and there is a clear solution that does not involve multiple containers. For example, your agency or vendor may ask you to put their GTM container on your site. Perhaps the agency wants to be able to quickly deploy remarketing pixels in support of the client, which is reasonable. However, I have never encountered a situation where adding an agency or vendor\u2019s GTM container is the best solution (or one I would even remotely consider).\n\nInstead, the best approach is to give the agency/vendor access to your GTM container. Now you have full visibility into the change they make and if needed, you can restrict their access so they can\u2019t publish any changes.\n\nSpeaking of publishing, it\u2019s important to remember is that anyone with publish permissions to a GTM container on your site has the potential to break your site. By putting multiple containers on your site, you\u2019re opening up the door for people who may not know what they\u2019re doing to insert custom HTML and/or JavaScript into your page. [Shiver] This can bypass important testing and security practices your IT team may have. This is not something to take lightly \u2013 multiple containers should always be the last resort.\n\nTechnical Pitfalls\n\nHowever, if you find yourself in a situation where multiple containers are the only option, here are the main technical pitfalls to be aware of:\n\ndataLayer Name\n\n\u201c\u2026 using more than one data layer can cause some triggers to stop working and could have other implications.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re implementing multiple containers on the page, you MUST use a single dataLayer. Although you can still rename the dataLayer (e.g. myDataLayer), you must rename the dataLayer for all containers. This is specifically called out in the documentation because in the past, unofficial recommendations were exactly the opposite.\n\ndataLayer Instantiation\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is with the dataLayer instantiation (instantiation is just a fancy way of saying \u201ccreation\u201d). If you have multiple \u201cowners\u201d of the page, and one of the GTM implementations instantiates the dataLayer like this:\n\ndataLayer = [{ 'name': 'value', 'name2': 'value2', ... }]\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\ndataLayer = [{\n\n'name2': 'value2',\n\nthen it will overwrite anything that happened to have been in the dataLayer already. This is also an issue even with single containers on a page, where the dataLayer is instantiated multiple time (often through externally loaded JavaScript libraries). Part of this problem traces back to Google\u2019s developer documentation:\n\nIf you follow Google\u2019s advice, the above code will completely overwrite any existing dataLayer variable. If there is already a dataLayer variable on the page with information (key/value pairs) in it, you will lose that information.\n\nThe proper, robust, fool-proof way to instantiate the dataLayer is as follows:\n\nvar dataLayer = window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer  [];\n\n1\n\nvar dataLayer = window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer [];\n\nThen always use dataLayer.push to push info into the dataLayer, like:\n\ndataLayer.push({ 'pageCategory': 'signup', 'visitorType': 'high-value' });\n\n1\n\n3\n\ndataLayer.push({\n\n'visitorType': 'high-value'\n\nThis method will work if it\u2019s the first time that the dataLayer is instantiated, or if it\u2019s the second time, tenth time, etc. If it finds an existing dataLayer, it will simply continue to add information. If it doesn\u2019t find a dataLayer, then it will create a new, empty dataLayer.\n\nUnintended Triggers\n\nBecause all containers are using a \u201cshared\u201d dataLayer, any events or other variables that get pushed to the dataLayer are available to both containers.\n\nThis can sometimes cause issues and confusion if, for example, one container pushes an event to the dataLayer that inadvertently causes a tag to fire in the other container.\n\nEssentially, you just need to avoid pushing \u201cgeneric\u201d events to the dataLayer (or having triggers that rely on \u201cgeneric\u201d events). For example, some people will push an event to the dataLayer like the following:\n\ndataLayer.push({ 'event': 'gaEvent', 'eventCategory': 'Example Category', 'eventAction': 'Example Action', 'eventLabel': 'Example Label', ... });\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\ndataLayer.push({\n\n'eventCategory': 'Example Category',\n\n'eventLabel': 'Example Label',\n\nThen they have a single Google Analytics event tag in GTM that triggers on the custom event of gaEvent.\n\nThis single tag can essentially handle many different events (as long as the category, action, label, etc. is pushed to the dataLayer).\n\nThis is not ideal for several reasons. As it relates to multiple containers, if both containers were pushing to the dataLayer in the same way, you would be accidentally firing tags for the other container\u2019s dataLayer pushes.\n\nUnintended Eavesdropping\n\nTo reiterate, anything that is in the dataLayer is available to both containers. Image the following hypothetical scenario:\n\nLunaMotors is an automotive manufacturer with independant car dealerships throughout the country. As part of their relationship with the dealers, they provide customizable websites. LunaMotors wants to track all these dealer websites (using GTM, of course), but many of the individual dealers also want to track their own websites (also with GTM), so we end up with two containers on the page.\n\nSome dealers are doing some really interesting stuff with lead generation and remarketing. As part of that they are pushing information like customer name, email, address, phone number, etc. to the dataLayer for use in various marketing tags (not for use in Google Analytics, which prohibits personally identifiable information \u2013 PII). For example:\n\ndataLayer.push({ 'name': 'Jim Gianoglio', 'email': 'myemail@gmail.com', 'phone': '555-1234', 'address': '123 Not My Address Drive', 'city': 'Pittsburgh' });\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\ndataLayer.push({\n\n'email': 'myemail@gmail.com',\n\n'address': '123 Not My Address Drive',\n\nHowever, LunaMotors isn\u2019t aware of this. To make matters worse, they are also pushing a variable called \u2018name\u2019 to the dataLayer, with the name of the dealership. So they have a variable in GTM that captures the name variable from the dataLayer, which they think is the name of the dealership, and are sending that as a custom dimension to Google Analytics. Unfortunately, because of the dealership use of the name dataLayer variable, now LunaMotors has PII in Google Analytics.\n\nThese types of accidental conflicts are less common, but it\u2019s the uncommon issues that catch you by surprise!\n\nOld V1 Legacy Listener Tags\n\nRemember in the old days of GTM, before auto event triggers, when we had to set up listener tags for clicks and form submissions? If you have any of these relics still hanging around in your container beware \u2013 they are not supported with multi-container setups. You will need to migrate them over to the auto event trigger configurations available in V2.\n\nParting Thoughts\n\nReasons for using multiple containers usually boil down to data governance issues.

      "alchemyapi_text": "  \t    \t\t\t\t  \t    \t\t\t\tBy Jim Gianoglio  /  \nApril 4, 2017\nIn 2015, Google began to officially support having multiple Google Tag Manager containers on a page. Fast forward nearly two years, and this question is starting to come up more frequently among clients and attendees at our trainings: \u201cIs it OK to have multiple GTM containers on my site?\u201d\nAlthough we strongly recommend only implementing one GTM container on the page, there may be some cases where it just isn\u2019t feasible:\nThese situations are not common, but tend to occur more regularly in large, complex organizations with many stakeholders interested in various aspects of analytics and marketing. For example, consider a large publisher that embeds its content on various third-party domains. The publisher wants their GTM code on the page, but the third-party domains may already have their own GTM code, and may be unwilling (for good reasons) to give the publisher access to their GTM. If you find yourself in this unavoidable boat, be sure to read the about the pitfalls below.\nHowever, sometimes the question comes up and there is a clear solution that does not involve multiple containers. For example, your agency or vendor may ask you to put their GTM container on your site. Perhaps the agency wants to be able to quickly deploy remarketing pixels in support of the client, which is reasonable. However, I have never encountered a situation where\u00a0adding an agency or vendor\u2019s GTM container is the best solution (or one I would even remotely consider).\nInstead, the best approach is to give the agency/vendor access to your GTM container. Now you have full visibility into the change they make and if needed, you can restrict their access so they can\u2019t publish any changes.\nSpeaking of publishing, it\u2019s important to remember is that anyone with publish permissions to a GTM container on your site has the potential to break your site. By putting multiple containers on your site, you\u2019re opening up the door for people who may not know what they\u2019re doing to\u00a0insert custom HTML and/or JavaScript into your page. [Shiver] This can bypass important testing and security practices your IT team may have. This is not something to take lightly \u2013 multiple containers should always be the last resort.\nHowever, if you find yourself in a situation where multiple containers are the only option, here are the main technical pitfalls to be aware of:\nThis is straight from Google\u2019s\u00a0developer documentation:\nIf you\u2019re implementing multiple containers on the page, you MUST use a single dataLayer. Although you can still rename the dataLayer (e.g. myDataLayer), you must rename the dataLayer for all containers. This is specifically called out in the documentation because in the past, unofficial recommendations were exactly the opposite.\nAnother thing to be aware of is with the dataLayer instantiation (instantiation is just a fancy way of saying \u201ccreation\u201d). If you have multiple \u201cowners\u201d of the page, and one of the GTM implementations instantiates the dataLayer like this:\nthen it will overwrite anything that happened to have been in the dataLayer already. This is also an issue even with single containers on a page, where the dataLayer is instantiated multiple time (often through externally loaded JavaScript libraries). Part of this problem traces back to Google\u2019s developer documentation:\nIf you follow Google\u2019s advice, the above code will completely overwrite any existing dataLayer variable. If there is already a dataLayer variable on the page with information (key/value pairs) in it, you will lose that information.\nThe proper, robust, fool-proof way to instantiate the dataLayer is as follows:\nThen always use dataLayer.push to push info into the dataLayer, like:\nThis method will work if it\u2019s the first time that the dataLayer is instantiated, or if it\u2019s the second time, tenth time, etc. If it finds an existing dataLayer, it will simply continue to add information. If it doesn\u2019t find a dataLayer, then it will create a new, empty dataLayer.\nBecause all containers are using a \u201cshared\u201d dataLayer, any events or other variables that get pushed to the dataLayer are available to both containers.\nThis can sometimes cause issues and confusion if, for example, one container pushes an event to the dataLayer that inadvertently causes a tag to fire in the other container.\nEssentially, you just need to avoid pushing \u201cgeneric\u201d events to the dataLayer (or having triggers that rely on \u201cgeneric\u201d events). For example, some people will push an event to the dataLayer like the following:\nThen they have a single Google Analytics event tag in GTM that triggers on the custom event of \u00a0gaEvent.\nThis single tag can essentially handle many different events (as long as the category, action, label, etc. is pushed to the dataLayer).\nThis is not ideal for several reasons. As it relates to multiple containers, if both containers were pushing to the dataLayer in the same way, you would be accidentally firing tags for the other container\u2019s dataLayer pushes.\nTo reiterate, anything that is in the dataLayer is available to both containers. Image the following hypothetical scenario:\nLunaMotors is an automotive manufacturer with independant car dealerships throughout the country. As part of their relationship with the dealers, they provide customizable websites. LunaMotors wants to track all these dealer websites (using GTM, of course), but many of the individual dealers also want to track their own websites (also with GTM), so we end up with two containers on the page.\nSome dealers are doing some really interesting stuff with lead generation and remarketing. As part of that they are pushing information like customer name, email, address, phone number, etc. to the dataLayer for use in various marketing tags (not for use in Google Analytics, which prohibits personally identifiable information \u2013 PII). For example:\nHowever, LunaMotors isn\u2019t aware of this. To make matters worse, they are also pushing a variable called \u2018name\u2019 to the dataLayer, with the name of the dealership. So they have a variable in GTM that captures the name variable from the dataLayer, which they think is the name of the dealership, and are sending that as a custom dimension to Google Analytics. Unfortunately, because of the dealership use of the name dataLayer variable, now LunaMotors has PII in Google Analytics.\nThese types of accidental conflicts are less common, but it\u2019s the uncommon issues that catch you by surprise!\nRemember in the old days of GTM, before auto event triggers, when we had to set up listener tags for clicks and form submissions? If you have any of these relics still hanging around in your container beware \u2013 they are not supported with multi-container setups. You will need to migrate them over to the auto event trigger configurations available in V2.\nReasons for using multiple containers usually boil down to data governance issues. If at all possible, it\u2019s always best to work out these issues internally and develop a system that only requires a single GTM container.\nHowever, if that is not possible, you may find yourself in the multi-container world with the pitfalls outlined above. At least now you know that those pitfalls exists, and how to avoid them.\n",

          "Pitfalls to Avoid with Multiple Google Tag Manager Containers",
          "Google Tag Manager",
          "0In 2015, Google began to officially support having multiple Google Tag Manager containers on a page",
          "Fast forward nearly two years, and this question is starting to come up more frequently among clients and attendees at our trainings: \" Is it OK to have multiple GTM containers on my site. \"",
          "Although we strongly recommend only implementing one GTM container on the page, there may be some cases where it just isn't feasible",
          "To restrict edit/publish permissions to some (but not all) tags, triggers, and variables",
          "To allow multiple site \"owners\" to autonomously tag a site",
          "These situations are not common, but tend to occur more regularly in large, complex organizations with many stakeholders interested in various aspects of analytics and marketing",
          "For example, consider a large publisher that embeds its content on various third-party domains",
          "The publisher wants their GTM code on the page, but the third-party domains may already have their own GTM code, and may be unwilling (for good reasons) to give the publisher access to their GTM",
          "If you find yourself in this unavoidable boat, be sure to read the about the pitfalls below",
          "However, sometimes the question comes up and there is a clear solution that does not involve multiple containers",
          "For example, your agency or vendor may ask you to put their GTM container on your site",
          "Perhaps the agency wants to be able to quickly deploy remarketing pixels in support of the client, which is reasonable",
          "However, I have never encountered a situation where adding an agency or vendor's GTM container is the best solution (or one I would even remotely consider)",
          "Instead, the best approach is to give the agency/vendor access to your GTM container",
          "Now you have full visibility into the change they make and if needed, you can restrict their access so they can't publish any changes",
          "Speaking of publishing, it's important to remember is that anyone with publish permissions to a GTM container on your site has the potential to break your site",
          "By putting multiple containers on your site, you're opening up the door for people who may not know what they're doing to insert custom HTML and/or JavaScript into your page",
          "This can bypass important testing and security practices your IT team may have",
          "This is not something to take lightly \u2013 multiple containers should always be the last resort",
          "However, if you find yourself in a situation where multiple containers are the only option, here are the main technical pitfalls to be aware of",
          "\"\u2026 using more than one data layer can cause some triggers to stop working and could have other implications.\"",
          "If you're implementing multiple containers on the page, you MUST use a single dataLayer",
          "Although you can still rename the dataLayer (e.g",
          "MyDataLayer), you must rename the dataLayer for all containers",
          "This is specifically called out in the documentation because in the past, unofficial recommendations were exactly the opposite",
          "Another thing to be aware of is with the dataLayer instantiation (instantiation is just a fancy way of saying \"creation\")",
          "If you have multiple \"owners\" of the page, and one of the GTM implementations instantiates the dataLayer like this",
          "Then it will overwrite anything that happened to have been in the dataLayer already",
          "This is also an issue even with single containers on a page, where the dataLayer is instantiated multiple time (often through externally loaded JavaScript libraries)",
          "Part of this problem traces back to Google's developer documentation",
          "If you follow Google's advice, the above code will completely overwrite any existing dataLayer variable",
          "If there is already a dataLayer variable on the page with information (key/value pairs) in it, you will lose that information",
          "The proper, robust, fool-proof way to instantiate the dataLayer is as follows",
          "Var dataLayer = window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer",
          "Var dataLayer = window",
          "DataLayer = window",
          "Then always use dataLayer.push to push info into the dataLayer, like",
          "This method will work if it's the first time that the dataLayer is instantiated, or if it's the second time, tenth time, etc",
          "If it finds an existing dataLayer, it will simply continue to add information",
          "If it doesn't find a dataLayer, then it will create a new, empty dataLayer",
          "Because all containers are using a \"shared\" dataLayer, any events or other variables that get pushed to the dataLayer are available to both containers",
          "This can sometimes cause issues and confusion if, for example, one container pushes an event to the dataLayer that inadvertently causes a tag to fire in the other container",
          "Essentially, you just need to avoid pushing \"generic\" events to the dataLayer (or having triggers that rely on \"generic\" events)",
          "For example, some people will push an event to the dataLayer like the following",
          "'eventCategory': 'Example Category'",
          "'eventLabel': 'Example Label'",
          "Then they have a single Google Analytics event tag in GTM that triggers on the custom event of gaEvent",
          "This single tag can essentially handle many different events (as long as the category, action, label, etc",
          "Is pushed to the dataLayer)",
          "This is not ideal for several reasons",
          "As it relates to multiple containers, if both containers were pushing to the dataLayer in the same way, you would be accidentally firing tags for the other container's dataLayer pushes",
          "To reiterate, anything that is in the dataLayer is available to both containers",
          "Image the following hypothetical scenario",
          "LunaMotors is an automotive manufacturer with independant car dealerships throughout the country",
          "As part of their relationship with the dealers, they provide customizable websites",
          "LunaMotors wants to track all these dealer websites (using GTM, of course), but many of the individual dealers also want to track their own websites (also with GTM), so we end up with two containers on the page",
          "Some dealers are doing some really interesting stuff with lead generation and remarketing",
          "As part of that they are pushing information like customer name, email, address, phone number, etc",
          "To the dataLayer for use in various marketing tags (not for use in Google Analytics, which prohibits personally identifiable information \u2013 PII)",
          "'address': '123 Not My Address Drive'",
          "However, LunaMotors isn't aware of this",

      "alchemyapi_text": "Several weeks ago I got an unexpected request. Fellow tech educator Cathy Jo Nelson is president-elect of the South Carolina Association of School Librarians (SCASL), and was in charge of this year\u2019s conference, to be held at the Hyatt in Greenville.  Cathy as if I, as a resident who blogs about our town, would be willing to say a few words about Greenville before the keynote address.  I was flattered.  Of course I said yes.\nOver the years I\u2019ve worked closely with the media specialists, both in my district and in technology workshops around the state.  Even in retirement I still maintain close contact with many of them through social media.  It wasn\u2019t as if this were an unknown quantity.  Even so, I found myself crafting my five minute presentation carefully to answer questions like, \u201cWhy is this guy talking to us?\u201d\nCathy had asked me to bring some of my photography as well.  In the end I decided to have an independent slide show with photos from around town that looped as talked about other stuff in my speech.  This wouldn\u2019t be a traditional PowerPoint where I addressed the slides as they appeared.\nThe appointed Thursday came and I headed over to the Hyatt.  Cathy greeted me and got me oriented.  Since I had a bit of time I strolled through the exhibit hall.\nMy friends Debbie Jarrett and Donna Thompson from SCETV had their booth set up, so I spent some time chatting with them.\nFor the rest of the exhibits I fell back into my old conference exhibit hall behavior of browsing without making eye contact.  After all, I wasn\u2019t really the guy they wanted to talk to.  Not this time.  Not anymore.\nI found a cup of coffee, then bumped into one of my former tech coordinators, Lori Vinson.  We caught up awhile, then it was time for the plenary session. \nThe room was large, and there was some preliminary comments before Cathy introduced me.  I babbled a bit, but overall I think things went very well.  Here are a couple more photos posted to Twitter as I spoke:\nI didn\u2019t stay for the keynote, but left after my short talk.  One attendee followed me out to tell me that my father had been the one to hire her, and that she followed my work on SCIWAY.net.  I also got a nice Facebook message from a former student from Gray Court who is now a media specialist in Rock Hill.  Both of those encounters made me feel much better about my presentation.\nCathy asked if my slideshow were available, so I posted it to YouTube.  I have it embedded below:\nHere\u2019s the text of my speech from the morning.  I ad libbed a bit, but this is the gist of it embedded as a Google Doc:\nI had a great time seeing these folks and interacting with them, even if it was on such a limited basis.  It looks like the rest of the conference was excellent, and I\u2019m grateful to Cathy for letting me be a part of it.  \nIt was the PERFECT welcome to Greenville, Tom. I can\u2019t think of anyone better to do this, though my local arrangements chair is now tasked with the same conundrum, finding someone to give us a 5 minute welcome before the keynote for our conference in March 2018, which is again in Greenville. I\u2019m so glad I asked you. I couldn\u2019t be happier with your speech, your pictures, and your willingness to help a friend out.  You still have such a way with words and captured the awe of our entire room of attendees. Also, thanks for sharing the video of pictures with everyone!\n",

AdObject 2. UpdateObject 3. DeleteObject 4. DeleteObjectByID. I then created a class \"AuditService\" which implements IDataService. Next I have a class \"DataLayer\" which via Dependency Injection, takes a class of type IDataService in it's constructor. My goal is to have a general class that I can plug multiple service classes into and avoid dependencies.\n\nThe problem I'm having is this. I need to add additional methods to the different service classes ie: in this case the \"AuditService\" class that are unique to this module. The problem I'm having is the added methods that are not implemented as part of the IDataService interface are not showing up when I instantiate the DataLayer class. I have added a property in DataLayer that returns the service class that it was instantiated with thinking that would expose the added methods of AuditService. But it does not. Is there a way to do this. Again, \"How do you expose methods of a class that are added beyond the scope of the interface which it impliments?\n\nAny Help would be very appreaciated.\n\nThank You\n\npublic interface IDataService { bool AddObject<T>(ref T obj); bool UpdateObject<T>(T obj); bool DeleteObject<T>(T obj); bool DeleteObjectByID(int id); }\n\npublic class AuditService : IDataService { #region Declarations public const string ASCENDING = \"asc\"; public const string DESCENDING = \"desc\"; public const int DEFAULT_VALUE = 0; #endregion\n\n#region Methods\n\npublic System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<Audit> GetAuditSearch(string sorttype,  string sortfield, string sortdir, string search) { }\n\npublic IEnumerable<Audit> GetAudits(string sortfield, string sortdir) { }\n\npublic virtual Audit GetAuditByID(int id){ }\n\npublic bool AddObject<T>(ref T obj){ }\n\npublic bool UpdateObject<T>(T obj) { }\n\npublic bool DeleteObject<T>(T obj){ }\n\npublic bool DeleteObjectByID(int value) { }\n\n#endregion }\n\npublic class DataLayer { #region \"Declarations\"\n\nprivate IDataService _service; protected static string _ConnStr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"program\"].ConnectionString;\n\n#endregion\n\n#region Properties public SqlConnection ProgramConn { }\n\n/// <summary> /// Use to call specific methods /// </summary> public IDataService Methods { get { return _service; } }\n\n#endregion\n\n#region Constructors public DataLayer(IDataService service) { this._service = service; }\n\n#endregion\n\n#region Methods\n\npublic bool AddObject<T>(ref T obj) { return this._service.AddObject(ref obj); }\n\npublic bool UpdateObject<T>(T obj) { return this._service.UpdateObject(obj); }\n\npublic bool DeleteObject<T>(T obj) { return this._service.DeleteObject(obj); }\n\npublic bool DeleteObjectByID(int id) { return this._service.DeleteObjectByID(id); } #endregion }\n\n// SAMPLE IMPLIMENTATION OF DataLayer\n\npublic static bool DeleteAuditByID(int id) { DataLayer d = new DataLayer(new AuditService()); return d.DeleteObjectByID(id); }\n\nDuckkiller53 Duckkiller53@gmail.com\n\n\u2039 Previous Thread Next Thread \u203a\n\n",
