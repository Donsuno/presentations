## And Swift

# It's Still In Beta

## That means it crashes a lot

## Playgrounds are still a problem

# What is Sprite Kit?

---

## Released in 2013

It's a 2d game development library with a bunch of stuff to help you
make 2d games.  It's got physics built in.  It's kindof awesome.

## New stuff for iOS 8?

Oh Yeah.  Like the Level Designer

## There's more

But most of it is too complicated to talk about in a short presentation.
